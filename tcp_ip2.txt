The 4 layers of the TCP/IP model
TCP/IP functionality is divided into four layers, each of which includes specific 
protocols:

The application layer provides applications with standardized data exchange. Its 
protocols include HTTP, FTP, Post Office Protocol 3, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and 
Simple Network Management Protocol. At the application layer, the payload is the actual 
application data.
The transport layer is responsible for maintaining end-to-end communications across the 
network. TCP handles communications between hosts and provides flow control, multiplexing 
and reliability. The transport protocols include TCP and User Datagram Protocol, which is 
sometimes used instead of TCP for special purposes.
The network layer, also called the internet layer, deals with packets and connects 
independent networks to transport the packets across network boundaries. The network 
layer protocols are IP and Internet Control Message Protocol, which is used for error 
reporting.
The physical layer, also known as the network interface layer or data link layer, 
consists of protocols that operate only on a link -- the network component that 
interconnects nodes or hosts in the network. The protocols in this lowest layer include 
Ethernet for local area networks and Address Resolution Protocol.
